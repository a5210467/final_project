The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or column or diaginal or it is a stalemate.

I am using the MCTS for implement the AI. I still not implement the easy AI.

https://github.com/KeithGalli/Connect4-Python is a reference for me to implement the rule and logic.

MCTS chapter in class is also a reference for me. I implment the Node based on that.

After you run the program. first the AI will search for 800 times for initial and then based on your move to learn more.
